Final Project: Local Testing Instructions
We have created a smaller dataset that you can use to easily test your code for the Final Project for Intro to Hadoop and MapReduce. To do so, please follow these steps:

Make sure that all of your code for the Final Project is saved in the same folder on your machine.
Download the test data here.
Save the test data file you just downloaded (it's called student_test_posts.csv) in the same folder as your code for the Final Project.
For each exercise in the Final Project, repeat steps 5 through 7 with the proper file names. The example used here is the Student Times exercise.
Open up a terminal or command line window on your computer, and navigate to the folder where your Final Project code and student_test_posts.csv are.
Run the following command to display your codeâ€™s output: $ cat student_test_posts.csv | python student_times_mapper.py | sort | python student_times_reducer.py
Compare your results to the corresponding expected output: 
Student Times expected output
Post and Answer Length expected output
Top Tags expected output
Study Groups expected output
